/**
 * Source-adapter seam for Quinn's grounding retrieval.
 *
 * `search_knowledge` used to call the knowledge base directly (the only
 * grounding source that existed). This module generalizes that into a
 * `KnowledgeSource` per grounding source — the knowledge base always,
 * feedback posts, admin-curated snippets, and the same customer's own
 * past-conversation summaries each behind their own flag — composed by
 * `retrieveKnowledge` into one ranked, budgeted result.
 *
 * Mirrors the static-plus-flagged-dynamic shape of `resolveToolSpecs()`
 * (assistant.toolspec.ts): the knowledge-base source is always registered; a
 * source gated behind a flag is registered only when that flag is on, via a
 * lazy import so this module never eagerly pulls in that source's domain.
 * With only the knowledge-base source registered (the flag-off default),
 * `retrieveKnowledge` is a byte-identical pass-through of
 * `retrieveKbArticles`'s own ranking — merging and re-ranking a single
 * source's already-sorted output changes nothing.
